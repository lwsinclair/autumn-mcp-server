```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @SirTenzin/autumn-mcp-server --client claude
```

It also works for: [Cursor, Windsurf, Witsy, Enconvo, Goose and SpinAI](https://smithery.ai/server/@SirTenzin/autumn-mcp-server).

### Manual without Smithery

Its much easier to visit the above Smithery link and just copy the correct command, but if you are more daring, here's the manual steps:

- Claude:

1. `git clone` this repo
2. Run `bun install` in the folder to install dependencies
3. Copy the absolute path to "index.ts"
4. Add the following to your claude_desktop_config.json or equivalent to your AI app:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
        // ...
		"autumn": {
			"command": "bun",
			"args": [
				"run",
				"{YOUR ABSOLUTE PATH TO index.ts}",
				"--apiKey=\"{YOUR API KEY}\""
			]
		}
	}
}
```

- Any other app:

If you want to run manually, you must have [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed to run this MCP server.
Here's the command for other apps that support commands instead:
```bash
bun run {absolute path to index.ts} --apiKey="{your api key}"
```

You may use either your public or secret key, but some features may not be accessible using the public key.
